#Effects of soil moisture on plants: 

**Moisture and germination**
<br>
Moisture availability has been regarded as the major factor determining the onset of germination. Germination is assumed to start if the soil moisture content is higher than 1.2 times Wilting point. As long as this condition is satisfied, germination proceeds unhampered through its various phases, until at the end of seven days germination is assumed to be completed and emergence occurs. If the soil dries out to less than 1.2 times Wilting point within 4 days after the onset of germination, the process is halted and will resume after rewetting from the point where it stopped. If drying out occurs four or more days after the onset of germination, deterioration of the germinating seeds takes place. If the dry conditions persist for more than six days, the seeds are assumed dead and there will be no crop established from that seed.

**Water uptake and extraction patterns are related to root density**
 In general 50 to 60 percent of the total water uptake occurs from the first 0.3 m (1ft), 20 to 25 percent from the second 0.3 m (1ft), 10 to 15 percent from the third 0.3 m (1ft) and less than 10 percent from the fourth 0.3 m (1ft) soil depth. Normally 100 percent of the water uptake occurs over the first 1.0 to 1.5 m (3.3 - 5.0 ft).

**Soil temperature and plant growth**
Soil temperature affects plant growth indirectly by affecting water and nutrient uptake as well as root growth. At a constant moisture content, a decrease in temperature results in a decrease in water and nutrient uptake. At low temperatures, transport from the root to the shoot and vice versa is reduced.

The optimum temperatures for root growth are probably lower than for shoot growth and can differ with growth stages. The optimum temperature for root growth of spring wheat was found to be 22°C or less.

**Soil temperature and germination**
Soil temperature affects the germination and growth of cereal crops. Soil temperature varies with time and depth, and is determined by the radiation reaching the soil surface, the quality of the surface thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the soil.
Spring cereals seems to emerge rapidly at soil temperatures ranging from 24 to 28°C. The rate of emergence of spring wheat increased from 6 to 24°C, however, final emergence was not affected. The minimum temperature for germination of cereal crop is 4°C and preferred temperature is 20°C.

**Temperature and plant growth**
Temperature determines the rate of crop development and consequently affects the length of the total growing period of the crop. Growth starts at some minimum temperature (4-5°C). As temperature increases, rate of plant growth increases until an optimum temperature is reached. Mean daily temperature for optimum growth and tillering is between 15 and 20°C. The rate of growth will decline as the temperature rises above this otimum range. At the end growing season, growth will stop when air temperature falls below 5°C.

The interval between floral initiation and anthesis is shorter at high temperature (30°C) than at low temperature (10°C). Increased light intensities resulted in an increased rate of elongation of the developing inflorescence and earlier anthesis (flowering). 


**NOTE : What is Permanent Wilting Point?**

Permanent plant wilting occurs when the volumetric water content in the soil is too low for the plant's roots to extract water. About half of the water in the soil at field capacity is held too tightly to be accessible to plants. The soil is considered to be at permanent wilting point when the water potential in the soil is at or below -1.5 MPa, so the permanent wilting point is the water content of the soil at -1.5 MPa water potential.

Soil at permanent wilting point is not necessarily "dry". When the water content of a soil is below the permanent wilting point, water is still present in the soil, but plant roots are unable to access it.
