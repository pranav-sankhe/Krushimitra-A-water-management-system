The current situation for farmers in India is a heart wrenching story. The very people who feed the nation are faced with starvation, and even a killer shortage of water. So as the engineers of India we consider it as our responsibility to contribute for solving these problems by providing a technological solution. So here's our idea about managing the water supplied to the crops by means of drip irrigation. 

The data which will be taken as an input for our system will be the moisture content, location of the space(rainfall at the particular area), type of crop, type of soil and the temperature of surrounding. By manipulating this data we will control the irrigation by basically controlling the time and if possible the flow of water pump.

For building the control system we will use an arduino and soil moisture sensors(which are easily available). The water pump which we wiall be using will be the one which is used in aquariums, fish ponds. Also a control panel will be made available to the user to select the type crop and the soil he is using which will further affect the flow of water.
